
### About

Since November 2017, I am a researcher at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Munich, Germany). 

From May 2011 to October 2017, I was a Posd-doc (Assistant Professor) at the University of Innsbruck (Austria), where I worked with Prof. Thomas Fahringer in the DPS group. During my time in Innsbruck, I contributed to some challenging problems on the field of auto-tuning parallel applications within the context of the Insieme Compiler and Multi-objective Scheduling for executing workflows on IaaS Clouds. 

I received my PhD from the University of Malaga (Spain) where I worked on the design and Implementation of parallel and distributed multi-criteria optimization methods, in particular from the field fo Metaheuristics. 

During my PhD studies, I visited and collaborated with Professors at other institutions: 

*I spend two Months (June-July 2018) in KingÂ´s Collegue London under the Supervision of Prof. Mark Harman (who later moved to University Collegue London, and currently holds an Engineering Manager Position at Facebook)
*From March 2010 to April 2017 I visited the University of Luxembourg and I worked under the supervision of Prof. Pascal Bouvry and Dr. Bernabe Dorronsoro 
*I visited Prof. Qingfu Zhang, at the University of Essex from June 2010 to July 2010 (Prof. Zhang has taken a long leave and is now working at the City University of Hong Kong).
