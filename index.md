
### About

Scientific Employee at [Leibniz Supercomputing Centre of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Munich, Germany)](https://www.lrz.de) since November 2017.

From May 2011 to October 2017, I was a Posd-doc (Assistant Professor) at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at) (Austria), where I worked with [Prof. Thomas Fahringer](https://www.dps.uibk.ac.at/~tf) in the [DPS group](https://www.dps.uibk.ac.at). During my time in Innsbruck, I contributed to some challenging problems on the field of auto-tuning parallel applications within the context of the [Insieme compiler](https://www.insieme-compiler.org) and multi-objective scheduling of workflows for IaaS clouds. 

I received my PhD from the [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es) (Spain) where I worked on the design and Implementation of parallel and distributed multi-criteria optimization methods, in particular from the field fo Metaheuristics. I keep my collaboration with [Dr. Antonio J. Nebro](https://www.lcc.uma.es/~antonio) in developing and maintaining (whenever I have some time) [jMetal](https://jmetal.github.io/jMetal), which we started during my PhD (extending or starting from quasy-scratch an Antonio's previous idea called DEME). 

You can hire my services for consultancy regarding jMetal or Multi-objective optimization. Feel free to contact me at juanjo.durillo@gmail.com

While working towards my PhD, I visited different institutions and collaborated with different Professors: 

* I spent two Months (June-July 2018) in KingÂ´s Collegue London under the Supervision of Prof. Mark Harman (who later moved to University Collegue London, and currently holds an Engineering Manager Position at Facebook)

* From March 2010 to April 2017 I visited the University of Luxembourg and I worked under the supervision of Prof. Pascal Bouvry and Dr. Bernabe Dorronsoro 

* I visited Prof. Qingfu Zhang, at the University of Essex from June 2010 to July 2010 (Prof. Zhang has taken a long leave and is now working at the City University of Hong Kong). 

My research interests include:
* Cloud computing
* Parallel and Distributed programming
* GPU Computing
* Software autotuning
* Multi-objective optimization
* Machine Learning
